ðŸŒ¸ Project Title: Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning
ðŸ“Œ Objective:
The main objective of this project is to build and evaluate different machine learning models that can classify iris flowers into three species â€” Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica â€” based on their sepal and petal measurements.

ðŸ“š Dataset:
Source: The project uses the Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets.load_iris.

Features:

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)

Target/Label:

Species: {0: setosa, 1: versicolor, 2: virginica}

ðŸ§¾ Steps Involved:
1. Importing Required Libraries:
Modules like NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn are imported for data handling, visualization, and model building.

2. Loading and Preparing the Data:
The Iris dataset is loaded using load_iris().

A DataFrame is created with feature columns.

The numeric species labels (0, 1, 2) are mapped to their string equivalents ('setosa', 'versicolor', 'virginica').

3. Data Exploration:
df.head(), df.info(), and df.describe() are used for a quick overview.

Pairplot with seaborn is used to visually explore pairwise relationships between features.

Heatmap shows correlation between features.

4. Feature and Label Separation:
X: Feature variables (sepal and petal measurements).

y: Target variable (species).

Data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

5. Model Building & Evaluation:
ðŸ”¹ a. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
Trained with n_neighbors=3.

Evaluated using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.

ðŸ”¹ b. Logistic Regression:
Model trained with max_iter=200.

Evaluation based on accuracy.

ðŸ”¹ c. Decision Tree Classifier:
Simple Decision Tree model trained and evaluated based on accuracy.

6. Model Serialization:
The best-performing model (in this case, KNN) is saved using joblib into a file named iris_model.pkl for future use.

ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy Score: Measures overall correct predictions.

Confusion Matrix: Shows true vs predicted classifications.

Classification Report: Includes precision, recall, f1-score for each class.

ðŸ§  Machine Learning Models Used:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

ðŸ’¾ Output:
A trained and saved model file: iris_model.pkl

Visualizations for understanding feature relationships and model performance.

ðŸ”š Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how classical machine learning algorithms can be applied to a well-known dataset for classification tasks. It covers the full pipeline from data exploration, visualization, model training, evaluation, and saving the model for deployment or reuse.
